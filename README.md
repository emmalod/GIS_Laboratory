## Project Description

This is the official repository of the Geographic Information System project, a course held in Politecnico di Milano during the Academic year 2022/23.

In this repository you can find the design and the implementation of a website in which we present our GIS project about a landslide risk analysis in the Lombardy region. It contains the files and images needed to operate the website, composed of three web pages:

- Home (index.html)
- Our project (our-project.html)
- Results (results.html)
- WebGIS (web-gis.html)
- About Us (about-us.html)

The folder "Group_6" contains all the mandatory outputs of our project.
